## 4DCT Viewer

Welcome to the 4DCT Viewer, an alpha version MATLAB tool designed to visualize 4D Computed Tomography (4DCT) data. This tool provides functionality for viewing multiple phases of 3D CT scans in different orientations and allows for easy navigation through the phases.

### Features
- **Folder Selection**: Choose a folder containing the n-phases 3D CT scans.
- **Windowing Settings**: Select from different windowing settings to adjust image contrast and brightness. (Custom windowing feature coming soon)
- **Orientation Views**: View the CT scans in axial, coronal, and sagittal orientations.
- **Multiplanar Reconstruction (MPR)**: Coming soon, this feature will display all orientations simultaneously for comprehensive analysis.
- **Phase Navigation**: Navigate through the phases of the 4DCT by pressing the space bar.
- **Zoom Functionality**: Zoom into the images by holding down the Shift key and scrolling.
- **Reset View**: Press the Esc key to return to the original axes.
- **Measurement Add-On**[Alpha]: An add-on is included for performing various measurements, such as setting a circular region of interest (ROI), line profile analysis, and distance measurement.

### Usage
1. Run the MATLAB script.
2. Select the folder containing the n-3D CT scans.
3. Adjust windowing settings and choose the desired orientation view.
4. Navigate through the phases using the space bar.
5. Zoom into images using Shift key + scroll.
6. Press Esc to reset the view.
7. Utilize the measurement add-on for analyzing specific regions of interest.

### Note
This version of the 4DCT Viewer is in its alpha stage, and updates will be released to enhance functionality and usability. Stay tuned for upcoming features, including custom windowing and multiplanar reconstruction. Different versions (more advanced) exists and will be uploaded in the future, those can be used for more advanced studies regarding 4DCT.
